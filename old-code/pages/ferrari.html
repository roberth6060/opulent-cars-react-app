          Ferrari is an Italian luxury sports car manufacturer founded by Enzo
          Ferrari in 1939. The company's headquarters are located in Maranello,
          Italy, and it is one of the most well-known and successful sports car
          brands in the world. <br />

          Ferrari was born in 1898 in Modena, Italy. He was a racing driver and
          team manager for Alfa Romeo before starting his own company, Scuderia
          Ferrari, in 1929. The company acted as a racing team for Alfa Romeo,
          but Ferrari's true passion was building sports cars. In 1939, he left
          Alfa Romeo to start his own car company, which he named Auto Avio
          Costruzioni.<br />

          Ferrari's first car, the Tipo 815, was a race car that was built in
          1940. However, World War II interrupted the company's operations, and
          it was not until 1947 that the first Ferrari-badged car, the 125 S,
          was produced. This car was powered by a 1.5-liter V12 engine, and it
          marked the beginning of Ferrari's long and successful history of
          building high-performance sports cars.<br />

          In the 1950s, Ferrari established itself as a dominant force in
          racing, winning numerous championships and setting numerous speed
          records. The company's cars were known for their impressive speed and
          handling, and they quickly gained a reputation for being some of the
          best sports cars in the world.<br />

          In the 1960s, Ferrari continued to innovate and release new models,
          including the 250 GTO, which became one of the most iconic and
          valuable sports cars ever produced. The company also expanded its
          operations, opening new factories and showrooms around the world.<br />

          In the decades that followed, Ferrari continued to release new models
          and improve upon existing ones. Some of the most famous Ferrari models
          include the 365 GTB/4, also known as the "Daytona," and the
          Testarossa, which was featured in the popular 1980s television show
          "Miami Vice."<br />

          Today, Ferrari is a globally recognized brand and a symbol of luxury
          and performance. The company's cars are highly sought after by
          collectors and enthusiasts, and they continue to be known for their
          impressive speed and handling.<br />
